"    <p>\n"
"    You can create as many Feeds importer configurations as you would "
"like to. Each can have a distinct purpose like letting your users "
"aggregate RSS feeds or importing a CSV file for content migration. "
"Here are a couple of things that are important to understand in order "
"to get started with Feeds:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Every importer configuration consists of basic settings, a "
"fetcher, a parser and a processor and their settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    The <strong>basic settings</strong> define the general behavior of "
"the importer. <strong>Fetchers</strong> are responsible for loading "
"data, <strong>parsers</strong> for organizing it and "
"<strong>processors</strong> for \"doing stuff\" with it, usually "
"storing it.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    In Basic settings, you can <strong>attach an importer "
"configuration to a content type</strong>. This is useful when many "
"imports of a kind should be created, for example in an RSS aggregation "
"scenario. If you don't attach a configuration to a content type, you "
"can use it on the !import page.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Imports can be <strong>scheduled periodically</strong> - see the "
"periodic import select box in the Basic settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Processors can have <strong>mappings</strong> in addition to "
"settings. Mappings allow you to define what elements of a data feed "
"should be mapped to what content fields on a granular level. For "
"instance, you can specify that a feed item's author should be mapped "
"to a node's body.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"

"users (spamming) of for example comments forms, user registration "
"forms, guestbook forms, etc. You can extend the desired forms with an "

"example, if you put a CAPTCHA on the user login block, which typically "
"appears on each page for anonymous visitors, caching will practically "
"be disabled. The comment submission forms are another example. In this "
